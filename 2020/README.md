All the answers will be written in matlab. Most matlab code is published into an html file, which is located in the html repository of that day. To view the html output instead of the source add htmlpreview.github.io/? before the url e.g. htmlpreview.github.io/?https://<span></span>github.com/cc-stan/Advent_of_code/blob/main/2020/DayX/html/dayX.html
